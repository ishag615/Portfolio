      <h2 class="section-title">Leadership & Involvement</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        I have always been a firm believer in the power of community and leadership. Since my first semester at college I have been actively involved in various on campus student leader roles along with leading student organizations. It started with being a part of the Honors Leadership Academy which gave me an opportunity to take a community service trip to Baltimore with my peers. I then began my role as the Vice President of the International Student Council which later led me to become the President the following year. As a sophomore, I got selected to be a Kent Student Ambassador, a role that helps me promote philantophy education and almuni engagement. In my junior year, I also took on the role of a Peer Mentor for the Honors College, where I guided new students through their initial college experience, helping them adapt and thrive in the academic environment.

      <h2 class="section-title">Work Experience</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        My various on campus employment opportunities have helped me grow both professionally and personally. I currently work as a Web Assistant at the College of Arts and Sciences, the largest college at Kent State University where I assist with improving the website and enhancing user experience by applying UI/UX skills. I also work with the various displays spread across the university. For these tasks, I have been trained to use Drupal, RiseVision and Google Analytics. I also work as a student researcher under my professor's guidance where we are conducting research on AI, cybersecurity of bluetooth channels and automation. Additionally, I have worked as a hearing officer in the Office of Student Conduct, where I used evidence based decision making to decided sanctions for various on campus incidents. These positions have honed my skills and helped me step outside of my comfort zone while learning new skills.

    <!-- Art & Creativity -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      <h2 class="section-title">Art & Creativity</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        I have always had a passion for art and creativity. Even though I love math and anything that involves computing, numbers and logic, creativity has always stayed close to my heart. I love to paint, sketch and experiment with different mediums. Art allows me to express myself in ways that words cannot. It also helps me relax and unwind after a long day of coding and studying. Below is a glimpse of some of my artwork.
